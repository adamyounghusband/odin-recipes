        <h2>About this Recipe</h2>
        <p>Made from a few simple ingredients, this vegan cauliflower dish wouldn’t look out of place in a smart restaurant. Serve as a starter, or with a salad for lunch or a light meal. Making your own harissa is really easy, but if you’re short of time you can use a jar of ready-made harissa instead.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>1 cauliflower, sliced into steaks approx. 3–4cm/1¼–1½in thick, young leaves removed and reserved</li>
           <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
           <li>2 tbsp harissa paste <em>(see below for recipe or use a jar)</em></li>
           <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
           <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
           <li>sea salt flakes, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><strong>Harissa Paste</strong>
            <li>125ml/4fl oz olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ tsp coriander seeds</li>
            <li>2 tsp hot smoked paprika</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
            <li>1 large chargrilled pepper (from a jar)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><strong>To Serve</strong>
            <li>2 heaped tbsp hummus</li>
            <li>1 tbsp pine nuts, toasted</li>
            <li>harissa, to drizzle</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the harissa, place all the ingredients into a food processor with a pinch of salt and blend, or use a pestle and mortar to grind until smooth.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
            <li>Rub the garlic cloves over the cauliflower steaks, then rub a teaspoon of the harissa you made and a pinch of salt over each steak, ensuring the entire steak is covered. Drizzle 1 teaspoon of the olive oil over a baking tray. Place the cauliflower on the baking tray and bake for 20 minutes. Turn over and bake for another 15 minutes (or 20–23 minutes if you like a slightly crispier texture).</li>
            <li>Oil another baking tray. Wash the reserved leaves and remove any tough stalks. Put the leaves in a bowl along with 1 teaspoon of harissa and ¼ teaspoon of salt then rub the leaves to coat them in harissa. Place on the baking tray. Bake for 15 minutes, or until crisp.</li>
            <li>To serve, divide the hummus between two plates and top with the cauliflower steaks. Add the crispy leaves around the plate and finish with a sprinkling of toasted pine nuts and a drizzle of harissa.</li>
        </ol>
